# Energy World

This web application was developed during a 24 hour hackathon (YB-Hackathon), hosted by YB and isolutions.

The web application serves the company ewb (Energie Wasser Bern) regarding customer sensitization in the fields of energy, mobility and sustainability. Through various interactions within the game, the user is sensitized to the above-mentioned topics in a playful way. Positive, i.e. sustainable or economically meaningful actions are rewarded with a strong point gain, while non-sustainable or wasteful actions only receive few points in return.
Ewb's business value particularly lies in the possibility of organising a competition; linking the ewb user profile with the game (direct influence of real life) and the associated customer loyalty.
